### HTML Lists, Control Flow w/JS, CSS Box Model
#### Ordered &amp; Unordered lists
1. An unordered list is used to make bullet points versus numbered list, when items are in no particular order.
2. The bullet style is changed as the indention changes to indicate sublists.
3. Ordered list should be used when listed numbered items versus unordered list when bullet points are desired.
4. You can change the order of the list by defining the starting number, or through counter increment in CSS.
#### The Box Model
1. In the story of "The Box Model", the margin is the outer border of the box and the padding is the stuff used to pad the 'pad' the inside of the box to protect the items in the box from damage. In the box model, the margin is the edge of the box and the padding provides spacing between the text and images away from the margin.
2. The 4 parts of the HTML box model can be expressed as the: head, foot, left and right sides of the body (top, bottom, left and right margins).
#### JavaScript Arrays, Operators, If-else, Loops
1. Data types stored in an array are: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, nulls
2. The 'people' array is a valid array and accessed through key-value attributes, such as name, age, occupation, interests, null values.
3. Shorthand assignments: *=, +=, -=, %=, /=
4. The result would be 'invalid' due to different data types: number, string, boolean = invalid operation.
5. When a choice need to be made whether to walk or drive a short distance. If sunny = walk, elseif raining = drive.
6. Use a loop to cycle through an array to assign values to a number of items in an array.
