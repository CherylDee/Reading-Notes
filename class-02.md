### Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
#### Intro HTML
1. Semantics is used in HTML to give web pages meaning that is easily understood by developers and browsers. The use of easy to recognize tags such a 'p' for paragraph 'h' for headings, 'ul/ol' for lists makes it an easier to use markup language.
2. There are 6 levels of headings in HTML numbered 1 through 6, ranging in size from the largest at 1 and the smallest at 6.
3. The use of 'sup' and 'sub' stands for 'superscript' meaning above the line, and 'subscript' meaning below the line. These are used in the case of exponents, degrees, and footnotes for superscripts, and logarithms and chemical notations, and such.
4. The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym. When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.
#### CSS Structure
1.  The application of CSS to HTML elements is referred to as 'inline styling' and it is used now mostly to override CSS or internal styling. It is used sparingly and usually when a document or is too short to call for a full CSS stylesheet. It is used to change the color of text, background, font-size, font-weight, and such.
2.  Inline styling is discouraged because on larger documents it can make it hard to find where the styling element is found and it is recommended that all styling elements be centrally located to make changes faster and easier.
3.  In the block of code, h2 is the selector, the CSS delaration are color and padding, and together with the values for each are the properties.
#### JavaScript and Conditionals
1.  **Strings**: a data type that are a sequence of text enclosed in single quote mark.
2.  Four types of JavaScript operators: *, /, +, -.
3.  Simple math problems comprise of real world problems that can be solved with a function: add, multiply, divide, subtract.
4.  An if statement checks a _condition_ and if it evaluates to _true_ then the code will execute.
5.  The _elseif_ statement runs when the condition is not met, then the 2nd if statement executes if the condition is met.
6.  Three comparison operators:  ==, <, > 
```
7.  The Logical operator && = both conditions are true, and || = either condition is true.
