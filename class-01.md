2. Parsing is the process of converting and analyzing syntax, string, symbols, structures, and languages into a format that can operate in runtime. HTML uses tokenization and tree construction by way of tags, attributes and values, including images. CSS parses the text it encounters into the CSS Object Model, and uses for styling the layout. JavaScript parses via a compiler or parser for running functions and methods.

3. Finding images to add to a website is boundless on the internet. There are plenty of free photos, clipart, gifs, images as desired. In addition to free images, there are plenty of paid images as well. But for me the best resources are free! Pixabay, Pexel, Unsplash, Clipart, are my go to resources for free images.

4.  To create a string in JavaScript use '' single quotes. Numbers need nothing, just enter the number.
5.  A variable is the same in JavaScript as it is in math and algebra. It's a placeholder used to represent a value, and they're important for changing values, calculations, and output.
6.  An HTML attribute contributes to the behavior of an element and is marked by tags.
7.  The anatomy of an HTML element is: the opening tag, the attribute, the value, the content, and the closing tag. All of this elements are used by the browser to display the information on a web page.
8.  HTML article and section tags works the same as in a newpaper or magazine. The article can refer to the larger element that contains sections or vice-versa depending on context. Just like the sports section of a newpaper may contain several articles relating to sports.
9.  The basic elements of a website is a home or landing page, web pages, information, images, and links. 
10. Metadata is data that describes the information contained on a webpage or on the website which is used by search engines to find search matches as the engines "crawl" through web pages. SEO specializes in matching keywords.
11. The meta tag typically contain keywords to help search engines find the information it's looking for on a webpage.
12. The first step in designing a websute is to have a clear vision and plan to meet the purpose and goal of the website.
