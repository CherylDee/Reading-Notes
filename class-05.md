### Images, Color Text
  1. Alt tags are needed for accessibility to allow everyone to use and enjoy the internet. It is also used when a browser is unable to render an image, the text is used in place of the image.
  2. Improved accessibility of images include using clear and description language to describe the image that makes it easy to know what the image portrays. 
  3. The figure element is used to markup a photo, drawing, illustration to provide discription and captioning. 
  4. A gif is a bitmap image made up of millions of pixels that are not very scalable to size, whereas an svg is a vector image that uses mathmatical equations to create an image, to make it scalable to very large size suitable for print. Vector images are not made with pizels.
  5. Anything made to use for the web should be made using 72dpi for media, because it is smaller and uses less bandwidth to display faster on the web. Images made for print generally take longer to download but the quality is much better at 300dpi versus 72dpi.

Using Color in CSSm, Styling HTML Text Elements
  1.  Foreground colors are the colors in the forefront of an image, whereas background is behind the main objects of an image. Foreground is the one in front, and background is behind the subject in the image.
  2.  I would use a mixture of light and dark colors to provide contrast, brightness and interests. Colors provide mood, thus the colors would need to reflect the mood of the site and compliment the images. 
  3.  Fonts like colors display mood, sensitivity and readability of a website. Fonts should be chosen with much care to set the mood of the website and display the seriousness, professionalism or playfulness of a website. 
  4.  Font-size is large, medium or small and it reflects the style of the site. Large text may be needed in sites geared for children or seniors. Small font size for professional, work, and design. Font-weight is bold or light text that also pertains to the mood or style of a website, along with font style such as serif and san-serif. Serifs are 'with feet' like Times, Garamond, Georgia, and san-serif are 'without feet' that are generally straight and narrow such as Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, Veranda which is a wide type.
  5.  You can add spacing to text letters with the tracking, leading, height, kerning, word-spacing, with other type tools, HTML, and CSS attributes.
