### Problem Domain, Objects and the DOM
  1. I would probably describe an object much like a noun: a person, place or thing that have attributes you can describe or assign by its characteristics or value. 
  2. Object literals in JavaScript allow us to create plain JavaScript objects. It consists of a list of key-value pairs, each separated by a comma and wrapped inside curly braces. The power of Object Literals is in their lightweight syntax, ease of use, and the facility with which they allow you to create name-spaced code.
  3. Functions are object, Arrays are objects, Regular Expression are objects and of course objects are objects. Objects are mutable data structure in javascript which is used to represent a 'Thing'. This could be anything like cars, plants, person, community etc. Because an array is an object and not a primitive, it can be used in any context appropriate for an object. An array can hold a collection of things, and object is a thing.
  4. When working with bracket notation, property identifiers only have to be a String. They can include any characters, including spaces. Variables may also be used as long as the variable resolves to a String. Variables cannot be used in dot notation. When working with dot notation, property identifies can only be alphanumeric (and _ and $). Properties canâ€™t start with a number.
  5. "This refers to the obj 'dog' and it's values. The advantage of using "this" is it's easily transferable to using with any object without having to refer to the object specifically by name. This becomes a variable for the object.
  6. The DOM is a programming interface for web documents and manipulation through structure changes, style, and content. It represents documents as nodes and objects so programming languages can interact with the page.
  7. JavaScript is a scripting language that can be used to manipulate a webpage that is a document and modify its content, style, and other values like an object.
