1. What is node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a great web framework for beginners because it works great for data-intensive applications, like streaming and real-time apps, and Node.js makes it easy to start building the back-end. V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser. 

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome V8 is an open source JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Node.js run a JS program directly and compiles it to machine code. Then OS execute this machine code. Every step I told earlier, happens in node program runtime. This is why Node.js is called "a javascript runtime built". Because Node binary built the JS program to machine code and OS executes it.

4. What is npm?
NPM – or "Node Package Manager" – is the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime Node.js.
It's also known as "Ninja Pumpkin Mutants", "Nonprofit Pizza Makers", and a host of other random names that you can explore and probably contribute to over at npm-expansions.
NPM consists of two main parts: a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
➜  ~ node --version
v19.7.0
➜  ~

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
➜  ~ npm --version
9.5.0
➜  ~

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
Each release of JSHint is published to npm, the package manager for the Node.js platform. You may install it globally using the following command: npm install -g jshint After this, you can use the jshint command-line interface. It is common to install JSHint as a development dependency within an existing Node.js project:
    
8. What is node used for?
Node is also used to build desktop apps, through the use of a framework called Electron. Electron powers Slack, Discord, Visual Studio Code, and Skype. Essentially, it runs a slimmed down version of Chrome designed for the desktop, and the app itself is actually just a web app.
