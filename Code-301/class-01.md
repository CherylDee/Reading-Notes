1.	What is React?
2.	React is a user interface library used to create parts of websites, parts of applications, charts, widgets, and any place the user will see in the browser and other places that React can go. Zac explains React is an agnostic user interface library that doesnâ€™t matter where the user interface will display or where the final component will be sent,whether in a browser or elsewhere, but React must always be used in conjunction with another React companion library.
3.	What is a component?
4.	A component is a small piece of code that fills a certain part of the user interface that is being built.
5.	What is the dataflow of React?
6.	React has a one-way data flow that is different from the familiar 2-way binding. One-way data flow is becoming the standard of the day.
7.	How do we make a React element a DOM element?
8.	The React element does not become a DOM element until it is passed through a separate component of DOM called React DOM, a companion library.
9.	React is a User Interface library.

10.	Which direction does data flow in React?
11.	Downward. Data flows down one way through a React app to its children components.
12.	Every component manages its own state and passes it down to its children components.
