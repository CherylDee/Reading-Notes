### Debugging
#### Troubleshoot JavaScript/The JavaScript Debugger
  1. The key difference between syntax error and logical error is a syntax error occurs due to an error in the syntax of a particular programming language while logical error is an error that occurs in the fault of the program algorithm or the logic. This can happen when the syntax is correct but the code delivers faulty results which can be harder to track down because there is no error message to lead to source of the error.
  2. Where to start too many to count. So far most problems have come from not writing the right code to yield the desired results. These have been both syntax and logic error, but mostly logic error that have to be resolve through consultation with TA's or Instructor. Syntax errors are easier to spot and correct, like spelling errors and wrong operators.
  3. Debugging is a major topic in the life of a programmer as 'bugs' are the bain of the programmers existence. Funny story how programming errors came to be called 'bugs' due to a literal bug was found to be the problem that caused a system error in the early days of computers with the old vacuum tubes or the ENIAC, if I recall the story correctly.
  4. Modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger that can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. Activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
  5.  Breakpoints are places where code execution can be stopped to examine variables while the code is executing.
  6.  The call stack is used by JavaScript to keep track of multiple function calls. It is like a real stack in data structures where data can be pushed and popped and follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
