### HTML Links, JS Functions, CSS Layouts
#### Hyperlinks
  1. Hyperlinks are created by using anchor tags \<a>Example\<a/>
  2. The href attribut is used with the anchor tag to point to the url of the link.
  3. Use the alt tag to provide text screen readers can use to point to an hyperlink.

#### CSS Layout
  1. Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout.
  2. A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, versus inline elements which do not start on a new line and only takes up as much space as needed. 
  3. Static positioning is the default of every HTML element and are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  4. Advantages of absolute positioning is cross-over browser support, uses document body only, removed from the flow.
  5. Fixed Position elements are completely independent of everything else on the web page; they are locked in position and always visible. Absolute is absolute. In this position, an element is placed with respect to themselves and it is excluded from the normal flow of the document.
#### Functions: Reusable blocks of code
  1. A function is a subprogram that returns a value. The data type of the value is the data type of the function. A function invocation (or call) is an expression, whose data type is that of the function. Before invoking a function, you must declare and define it.
  2. Use argument for a value or expression that contains data or code that's used with an operator or passed to a function. Use parameter for a value that's given to a variable and treated as a constant until the operation is completed.
  3. In Pair programming developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves. Pairs of developers are more likely to catch problems with code quality while working together. While the driver is focused on writing the code, the navigator is free to think about the style and function.
