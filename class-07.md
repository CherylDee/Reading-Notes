### Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
#### Domain Modeling, MTML Table Basics
  1. Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
  2. Tables are no longer used to layout web pages because they are too rigid for today's responsive designs and CSS rendering is no longer an issue. Screen readers reading table tags are confusing to users, and tables involve more complex markup than following CSS layout techniques.
  3. Three different HTML semantics used in the construction of tables are: th = table heading. This is used to create the heading of a table. TD = table data, this is used to create the cells to input data into a table. TR = table row, this is used to create the rows of a table which contain the table cells.

#### Constructors, Object Prototypes
  1. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will: create a new object, bind this to the new object so you can refer to this in your constructor code, run the code in the constructor and return the new object. Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create.
  2. The main difference is what you can do with it. With the constructor function notation you create an object that can be instantiated into multiple instances (with the new keyword), while the literal notation delivers a single object.
  3. Prototype is generally used for testing something in the developmental stage, versus and inheritance is a trait or some property or attribute that is inherit property or inherited. An inherit property has paced the initial testing phase and has become an established property. A prototype is still in development and is not yet an inherit property.
